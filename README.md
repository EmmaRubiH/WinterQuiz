### Bugs
I had some problems figuring out how to get from the starting page to the game page. It was easy with html. But that was not how I should do it. I wanted to use JavaScript. Finally, I asked my mentor for help. And he showed me ways to go and figure it out. By explaining more about localStorage. You can not solve everything by yourself. And I realised that! It is OK to ask for help.
