### Bugs
I hade som problems figure out how to get frome start page to game page. It was easy with html. But that was not how i should do it. 
I wanted to use JavaScript. Finaly i asked my super mentor for help. And he showed me ways to go and figure it out. By explaning more about localStorage.
You can not solve everything by your self. And i realise that! It is okey to ask for help.
